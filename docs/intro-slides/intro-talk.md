# About the course

* Base knowledge is required
* AWS is used for examples
* Test at the end of every section
* Coding challenge

<!-- 

This is an advanced course so some base prior knowledge is required. Initially, this course was developed for Java engineers, so the majority of demonstrated examples are based on the Spring Framework. Hope, it is not an issue. 

Microservices are widely used in clouds so a lot of examples here are deployed into AWS. Nevertheless, other cloud providers have similar services and provide similar capabilities so that the knowledge you get here will be relevant for other cloud providers as well. 

The course consists of 11 sections and at the end of every section there is a simple test for self-check. 

I also encourage you to solve a coding challenge which allows you to get practical experience.
